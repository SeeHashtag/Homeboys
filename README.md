## Synopsis

This project is designed to showcase the skills I developed while learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

## Motivation

The original website for Homeboy's Hot Sauce (http://www.homeboyshabanero.com/) was ready for an upgrade. I wanted the company's website to reflect the quality of their sauce.

My final product can be viewed here: https://seehashtag.github.io/Homeboys/

The Homeboy's webiste has since been updated, with inspiration from my redesign. The original site link above now redirects to their new website: https://cutinosauce.com/
